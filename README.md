## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of a running [Smart Contract Bounty Program](https://github.com/smart-contract-bounty). You can find the application process of the latest bounty [here](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Support-Docs/blob/master/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).  

:warning: Before you submit a milestone, make sure it complies with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Support-Docs/blob/master/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/use-inkubator/Bounty-Milestone-Delivery/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the contents of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**. 
   5. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone, including all deliverables as listed in your application.
   4. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md` or in the case of maintenance agreement `project_name-delivery_number.md`
   5. Create a pull request and fill out the comment template.
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. Evaluators can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. Bounty Evaluators will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
   1. The operations team receives a notification once the delivery is accepted. Payments are usually processed within 14 days.
   2. Payment is made to the Polkadot address specified in the initial application. The exchange rate for DOT depends on the time of payment.

Grant applications can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.
